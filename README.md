# fkm

Internal catalog app for FKM workshop PowerPoints.

The app scans configured SharePoint document libraries for `.pptx` files, extracts slide text, asks OpenAI to generate configured spreadsheet fields, stores the current catalog in Postgres with `pgvector`, provides semantic search, and exports the current catalog as Excel.

## App Shape

- [`catalog_app/api.py`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/api.py): FastAPI app, static UI, reload/search/export endpoints
- [`catalog_app/catalog_sync.py`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/catalog_sync.py): manual SharePoint reload workflow
- [`catalog_app/db/`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/db): schema and current-state Postgres helpers
- [`catalog_app/generation/configuration.py`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/generation/configuration.py): SharePoint sources and official Excel column configuration
- [`catalog_app/generation/`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/generation): Microsoft Graph, PowerPoint parsing, OpenAI metadata, and Excel export helpers
- [`catalog_app/static/`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/static): browser UI

## Current-State Storage

This app is designed for a small Azure App Service deployment, so Postgres stores current state only, not history.

- `presentations` stores one row per current PowerPoint. If Microsoft Graph reports a file was deleted or removed from the configured folders, the row is hard-deleted so search/export do not show stale files and the database does not grow forever.
- `presentation_sources` stores one row per configured SharePoint source plus its latest Microsoft Graph delta link. Delta links let Reload ask Graph for changes since the last successful reload.
- `sync_status` contains exactly one row. Each Reload overwrites it with the latest status, counts, timestamps, and error. Historical reload runs are intentionally not retained.

The full spreadsheet row is stored in `presentations.metadata` as JSON. Stable operational fields such as source key, drive ID, item ID, web URL, embedding, and timestamps also have normal columns so the app can update and search efficiently.

## Local Run

Start Postgres and the app:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Useful local command without Docker:

```bash
uv run uvicorn catalog_app.api:app --reload
```

## Workflow

1. Click **Reload from SharePoint**.
2. The app uses Microsoft Graph delta queries to find changed/deleted PowerPoints.
3. Changed PowerPoints are parsed, classified with OpenAI, embedded, and upserted into Postgres.
4. Deleted or removed PowerPoints are hard-deleted from Postgres.
5. Use the table, semantic search, or **Export Excel**.

The first successful reload establishes the baseline delta links. Later reloads use those links to fetch only changes.

## Required Environment Variables

Application:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: optional, defaults to `text-embedding-3-small`
- `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`: optional, defaults to `1536`

Microsoft Graph app credentials:

- `TENANT_ID`: Microsoft Entra tenant ID
- `CLIENT_ID`: app registration client ID used for Microsoft Graph
- `CLIENT_SECRET_VALUE`: app registration client secret value, not the secret ID
- `SITE_HOSTNAME`: SharePoint hostname, for example `contoso.sharepoint.com`
- `SITE_PATH`: SharePoint site path, for example `/sites/MySite`

## Azure App Service Authentication

Access control is handled by Azure App Service Authentication, not by FastAPI code.

In Azure App Service > Authentication, configure Microsoft as the identity provider:

- Tenant type: Workforce/current tenant
- Supported account types: Current tenant / single tenant
- Authentication: Require authentication
- Unauthenticated requests: HTTP 302 redirect
- Tenant requirement: Allow requests only from the issuer tenant

With that setup, requests from outside your organization are blocked before they reach the container.

## Azure Container Notes

The production image is built from [`Dockerfile.catalog-app`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/Dockerfile.catalog-app).

The container starts:

```bash
uv run uvicorn catalog_app.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-${WEBSITES_PORT:-8000}}
```

For Azure App Service custom containers, configure the app settings above and set the container port setting if your plan requires it.

## Changing The Catalog

Edit [`catalog_app/generation/configuration.py`](/Users/acheung/Desktop/fkm/catalog_app/generation/configuration.py).

- `DRIVE_SOURCES` controls which SharePoint drives/folders are scanned.
- `get_presentation_columns(...)` controls the official Excel export columns.
- Direct columns use generators that read Microsoft Graph or parsed slide data.
- AI columns use `registry.ai_generator(field_name, output_type, description)`.

After changing sources or columns, run Reload from the web UI. Column changes may require regenerating many rows and can take time and OpenAI tokens.
