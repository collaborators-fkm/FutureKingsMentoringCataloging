"""Project-wide settings and column definitions.

This is the main file to edit when you want to change what the export produces.

- Edit `DRIVE_SOURCES` to choose which Microsoft drives/folders are scanned.
- Edit `get_presentation_columns(...)` to decide which Excel columns exist.
- Leave the lower-level implementation details to the other modules.

For a beginner, this file is the safest place to customize behavior because it
describes *what* to include without requiring you to understand every helper
function in the codebase.
